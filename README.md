# Langchain Course for Beginners

Welcome to the LangChain Beginners Course repository! This course is designed to help you get started with LangChain, a powerful open-source framework for developing applications using large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT.

I have built 12 AI apps in 12 weeks using Langchain hosted on [SamurAI](thesamur.ai) and have onboarded million visitors a month.
